The idea of accounting and high finance stop the experienced and novice therapist alike. After all, we are people persons rather than formula folks. Time to change all that and jump in with a few office supplies and a couple of business categories. You can upgrade to a computerized system when your practice is in double-digit clients.

Get some file folders with pockets, a three ring binder (with A-Z tabs), and a package of basic bookkeeping sheets. Label one folder “Income” and the other “Expenses.” Designate one sheet for each client with first name, last initial. Punch some holes, and place your folders and sheets in your binder. (PICTURES)

Save all of your receipts in the Expense folder and reconcile weekly during your Business Meeting Hour. Don’t forget any credit card statements or online purchase receipts. Get our Free Checklist for Categories that Count: Typical Expenses for your Therapy Practice.
Capture checks, cash, and online generated credit card reports in your Income folder. We like Square for ease of use and clear, concise reports.

Use your individual client forms to capture date of service, amount paid, balance, and check number or credit card verification. PICTURE HERE. Give out receipts on a superbill — one that’s made especially for you or download ours here. 

Finally, have one bookkeeping sheet labeled Total Income and Expenses. Position it so it’s the very first sheet you see when you open your bookkeeping binder. (PICTURE  of Sheet). Each month report your Income and Expenses for an up-to-date picture of your financial reality.

Congratulations! You have created a simple yet effective bookkeeping system. You have everything you need to report to the IRS and to keep track of your hard-earned money. Read on if you are feeling confident enough to take it online….
